1 Project Title
Creating a Face Recognition System using Classical Machine Learning Algorithms
2 Project Description
This machine learning project aims to develop a face recognition system using classical machine learning
algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). The project will utilize the LFW (Labeled Faces in
the Wild) dataset, available at http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-funneled.tgz. The primary
objectives of the project are twofold:
1. To understand the full life-cycle of developing a machine learning model to solve a real-world
problem.
2. To apply the knowledge gained from the course in a practical setting.
3 Project Scope
This project will be carried out by a group of 4-6 bachelorâ€™s degree students. The project is expected
to be completed within a timeframe of 3 weeks. Students will be required to submit weekly progress
reports to track their development and ensure that they are on track to meet their goals.
4 Project Tasks
The project will involve the following key tasks:
1. Data Collection: Download and preprocess the LFW dataset.
2. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from facial images.
3. Model Selection: Implement SVM or other classical ML algorithms for face recognition.
4. Model Training: Train the chosen model on the dataset.
5. Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
6. Deployment: Implement a simple interface for testing the face recognition system.
